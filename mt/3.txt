Dear WhatsApp Business Support Team,

My WhatsApp Business account (+62xxxxxxxxxxx) was recently blocked, possibly due to spam detection.

I want to clarify that I did send multiple messages to customers in a short period, but all were sent manually. I did not use any automation tools, bots, or unauthorized third-party apps. I understand that this may have triggered your system to flag my activity as spam, and I sincerely apologize for that.

This number is very important for my business and customer communication. I kindly ask for a second chance and a quick review of my account. I will be more careful in the future and make sure to follow all WhatsApp Business policies properly.

Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,  
[Nama lue]  
WhatsApp Number: +62xxxxxxxxxxx  
Business Name (optional): [Your Business Name]
