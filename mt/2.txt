Dear WhatsApp Support Team,

My WhatsApp account (+62xxxxxxxxxxx) has been permanently banned. I understand that my recent message activity may have been flagged as spam, and I sincerely apologize if it triggered any violations.

I want to clarify that I never used third-party tools, automation, or bots. All messages were sent manually, and I had no intention of violating WhatsApp’s Terms of Service.

This account is very important to me for personal communication with family and friends. I truly value the platform and kindly ask for a second chance. I will be more careful in the future and fully commit to following WhatsApp’s policies.

Please consider reactivating my account. I deeply appreciate your understanding and assistance.

Sincerely,  
[Nama lue] 
WhatsApp Number: +62xxxxxxxxxxx
