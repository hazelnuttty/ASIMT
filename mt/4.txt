Dear WhatsApp Business Support Team,

My WhatsApp Business account (+62xxxxxxxxxxx) has been temporarily blocked, possibly due to spam detection. I sincerely apologize if my recent activity triggered this action.

Please allow me to clarify that all messages were sent manually and individually to my customers â€” I did not use any bots, auto-send tools, or third-party software. I understand that sending too many messages quickly might have caused a false flag in the system.

This account is essential for my business communication with clients. I truly rely on WhatsApp Business for daily operations and customer service.

I respectfully ask for a second chance and a quick review of my case. I will strictly follow WhatsApp's policies moving forward and be more careful with message frequency.

Thank you very much for your time and support.

Sincerely,  
[Nama lue]  
Business Name: [Optional]  
WhatsApp Number: +62xxxxxxxxxxx
