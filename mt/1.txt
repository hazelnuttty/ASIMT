Hello WhatsApp Support Team,

I kindly request a review of my WhatsApp account: +62xxxxxxxxxxx

I believe my account may have been mistakenly flagged for spam. I was sending multiple messages manually in a short time, but I never used any bots, automation, or third-party tools.

I deeply apologize if my activity appeared suspicious. It was not intentional, and I fully respect WhatsAppâ€™s terms and policies.

This account is very important for my daily personal communication. Please consider reactivating it. I will be more careful in the future and ensure responsible usage.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding.
